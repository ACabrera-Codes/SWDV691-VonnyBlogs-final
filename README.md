# SWDV691-VonnyBlogs
The purpose of this application is to create an easy to use and simple blog application titled “VonnyBlogs”. The problem I am looking to solve is helping to shine a light on the underrepresented groups in my local community.This application will allow the user to browse posts, and if they have any post suggestions or would like for the administrator to post their blog or story, they can fill out a form for submission. The application will start on the main landing page, the blog tab will consist of the weekly highlighted posts.
